worked with PropTypes 
PropTypes do not need to be outside, you can put it into your component using static

ex: 

 ``` class Contact extends Component {

    static propTypes ={
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired, 

        email: PropTypes.string.isRequired, 

        phone: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    }
} `

need to learn how to annotate code in MD

## CSS with React 

to do styling in JSX you will need to use double curly brackets {{}}
You dont use - in JSX, You will have to use CamelCase.
So instead of 
   ```font-size````
    it will be , 
   ``` fontSize '' ```

You can also just create a variable and put all the information there, or just create a stylesheet for each component
